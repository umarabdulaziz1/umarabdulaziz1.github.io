        <p1 style="font-family:Forte;font-size:160%">hungry</p1>
        <p1>.They looked out the window. Where was their mother? She</p1><br><br>
        <p1>walked into the house. The children ran over to her. "Mama,we're so</p1>
        <p1 style="font-size:160%;font-family:Forte">hungry</p1>
        <p1>," they both<br><br> said.</p1>
        <p><p1>She said lunch was coming. She walked into the kitchen. She opened a can of chicken soup.<br><br> She pured the soup into a pot. She added water. She put the pot on the stove. She made<br><br> two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She sliced an apple. The soup was</p1>
            <p1 style="font-size:160%;font-family:Forte">hot.</p1></p>
        <p><p1>She poured it into two bowls. She put the sandwiches on two plates. She put apple slices on<br><br> each plate. She put the bowls and plates on the table. The children ran to the table. "Thank<br><br> you, mommy!" they said. Then they started eating. The cat and dog watched them eat.</p1></p>
